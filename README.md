# Thai Sentence Segmentation with mT5

## Introduction
-  Many writing systems indicate the end of a sentence with a punctuation mark. English, as well as many other European languages, ends its sentences with either a punctuation mark (.), a question mark (?), or an exclamation mark (!). In contrast, a number of languages lack a clear system to mark sentence boundaries, making sentence segmentation in NLP a challenging task. One of such languages is Thai.

- Punctuation in Thai hardly serves any functions in indicating the end of a sentence in a text: punctuation marks are used with abrreviated nouns, while question and exclamation marks are rarely used in formal domains[^1]. However, Thai orthography does make use of spaces to signal the end of a clause or a sentence, but it is largely subjective and varies from context to context, which is not a reliable method.

- Several methods have been proposed to tackle this issue. An alternative linguistic analysis is offered by Wirote Aroonmanakun (2007) who argues that clauses should serve as basic syntactic units instead of sentences.[^2] Different model architectures, such as CRF[^3] and BiLSTM-CNN[^4], are utilized in combination with n-gram and POS features for Thai sentence segmentation. Recently, researchers have been able to achieve the state-of-the-art result on the Orchid and UGWC datasets using advanced language model such as ELMo[^5] and WangchanBERTa[^6].

- So far, little attention has been paid to the implementation of sequence-to-sequence model. This project therefore aims to experiment on the segmentation task using Google's mT5, a multilingual varaint of the T5 model, with the newly released LST20 Corpus, in which 74,180 sentences are annotated.

- Our mT5-small model achieves a sentence-level F1 score of 31.9% on inputs with an English short prompt. Results also suggest that the language and phrasing used in prompts have an effect on the performance of the model.
